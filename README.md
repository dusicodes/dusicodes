### Hello people! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

 🧍🏾‍♂️ I'm [**Endurance**] but people call me [**Eddie**] for short, a Computer Science student at Lancaster Univeristy.

 I'm highly interested in **full-stack development** and currently doing projects for fun.

 My interest lies in delving deep into how technology can revolutionize both digital services and creative fields like photography and media production

 Outside of work, I like taking photos of people and create short documentaries about myself, thorough youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFn8knkW6dXeUZz-zbyrcng">dusi451</a>.
