### Hello people! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

 🧍🏾‍♂️ I'm [**Endurance**](https://gazijarin.com), a Computer Science student at Lancaster Univeristy.

 👽 I'm highly interested in **full-stack development** and currently doing project for fun.

My interest lies in delving deep into how technology can revolutionize both digital services and creative fields like photography and media production

Outside of work, I'm interested in the media creation. I like taking photos of people, and i have a youtube channel where i document my life.
